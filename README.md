This is a Business Analytics project I have worked on as part of Business analytics internship offered by YBI Foundation.

Mileage Prediction - Regression Analysis

Source:
This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.

Data Set Information:

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predictingthe attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset isavailable in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".
"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)
Attribute Information:

1. mpg: continuous

2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete

3. displacement: continuous

4. horsepower: continuous

5. weight: continuous

6. acceleration: continuous

7. model year: multi-valued discrete

8. origin: multi-valued discrete

9. car name: string (unique for each instance)
